#  Types
Java:
Java has 8 primitive data types. These include, bool, char, byte, short, int, long, float, and double. Java also provides special support for character strings via the java.lang.String class. The Java programming language is a statically typed language, which means that every variable and every expression has a type that is known at compile time. You can define your own reference types by creating instances of classes.  Java supports reference and variable types.

C++:

The different types in C++ can be classified as character types, numerical integer types, floating-point types, and Boolean types. The main character type is char. The numerical integer types can hold positive or negative number values and include short, int, long, and long long. The floating point types include float, double and long double. C++ also supports compund types such as strings which can hold different types of variables such as characters and integers. C++ supports refence types. You can create one by putting the & operator in front of the variable name. New value types cannot be created.
