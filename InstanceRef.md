#  "This" keyword

Java:
Within an instance method or a constructor, this is a reference to the current object. The most common reason for using the this keyword is because a field is shadowed by a method or constructor parameter. This keyword can also be used within a constructor to call another constructor in the same class. If present, the invocation of another constructor must be the first line in the constructor.

C++:
The keyword 'this' is an expression whose value is the address of the object, on which the member function is being called. There are different uses for the this keyword. It can be used to pass current object as a parameter to another method. It can be used to refer current class instance variable, and it can be used to declare indexers.
