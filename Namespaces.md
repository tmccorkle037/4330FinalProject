#  Namespaces
Java:
In java namespaces are called packages. The Java platform includes packages with names that begin with java, javax, and org.omg. The puporse of a package is to avoid naming conflicts within a program. To specify the package a class is to be part of, you use a package directive. The package keyword must be the first token of a java program followed by the name of the package and a semicolon.

C++:
Namespaces were created when C++ was created. 
Multiple namespace blocks with the same name are allowed, and all declarations within those blocks are declared in the named scope.
A namespace definition begins with the keyword namespace followed by the namespace name 
Namespace declarations appear only at global scope.
Namespace declarations can be nested within another namespace.
Namespace declarations donâ€™t have access specifiers. (Public or private)
No need to give semicolon after the closing brace of definition of namespace.
We can split the definition of namespace over several units.
