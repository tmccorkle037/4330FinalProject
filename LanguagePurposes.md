#  Language purposes/ Genesis
Java | C++
Java was developed by James Gosling and released in 1995. Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar. The main goal of this language was to have a "Write Once, Run Anywhere" design. | C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup with the purpose of making it easier to write good programs.
