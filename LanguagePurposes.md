#  Language purposes/ Genesis
Java:
Java was developed by James Gosling and released in 1995. Gosling and a group of other programmers began designing Java with the idea that the next generation of computing would combine digital consumer devices and computers. The primary goal was to create a language that could tackle most of the things that C++ offered while getting rid of some of the more tedious tasks that came with the earlier languages.The main design of the language was similar to C/C++ , since that was the language that most programmers were familiar with at the time. Java was released with the promise of a "Write Once, Run Anywhere" design. 

C++:
C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup with the goal of adding classes to the C language. He had previously been working with Simula 67 Language which he liked, but it was too slow for practical use so he began working on his own. His language included classes, basic inheritance, inlining, default function arguments, and strong type checking in addition to all the features of the C language. The first edition of the language was called C with Classes, but in 1983 the name was changed to C++. During this time, many additional features were added such as virtual functions, function overloading, references with the & symbol, the const keyword, and single-line comments using two forward slashes.
